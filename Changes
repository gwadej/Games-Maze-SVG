Revision history for Games-Maze-SVG

0.77    Sat Jul 20 10:10:00 2013
        - Fixed mistake in MANIFEST.SKIP that removed Makefile.PL from
          distribution.
0.76    Wed Jul 17 10:20:00 2013
        - Corrected some typos and other deficiencies in the manual.
        - Changed the toString method to to_string to be consistent with other
          capitalization. Made alias to old name that I can deprecate later.
        - Corrected POD error found by CPANTESTERs.
        - Moved POD tests so that they don't stop install.
0.75    6/2006
        - Corrected dependency on Test::MockModule that was causing CPAN
          tests to fail. If you don't have Test::MockModule, some tests
          will be skipped.
0.74    6/2006
        - Cleaned up event handling a little further in the script code.
          Now supports Batik and ASV a bit better.
        - Minor code cleanups to satisfy Perl::Critic.
0.73    6/2006
        - Finally added support for FireFox. The problem was caused by the
          keystroke handling interface. Corrected based on examples from the
          SVG Developers mailing list.
