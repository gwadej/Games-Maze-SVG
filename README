Games-Maze-SVG

This module is an extension to the Games::Maze module. Games::Maze::SVG
takes the mazes created by Games::Maze and converts them into an SVG
output. As an option, the SVG version of the maze can be made playable.

This module depends on Games::Maze, and Carp. The tests depend on Test::More.

Displaying the SVG mazes requires an SVG viewer or a browser that supports
SVG either natively or through a plugin. The mazes have been tested using
the Squiggle viewer (part of the Batik library), and Adobe SVG viewer on
both Firefox and Internet Explorer.

When using the Squiggle viewer to play the interactive maze, the arrow keys
are also used by Squiggle to move the image around. I have not yet found a
way around this. Using Ctrl-T to restore the original view is a workaround.
