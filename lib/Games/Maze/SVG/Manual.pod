=head1 NAME

Games::Maze::SVG::Manual - Manual for the Games::Maze::SVG modules.

=head1 PURPOSE

The Games::Maze::SVG module supports the creation of 2-dimensional mazes in
an SVG format suitable for printing or playing interactively. This module use
the Games::Maze module to perform the actual work of creating the mazes.

=head1 HISTORY

During the middle of 2004, my son was extremely interested in mazes. We could
not get enough mazes for him to solve. As a Perl programmer, I decided there
must be some way to generate mazes and went to CPAN. I found Games::Maze. I
printed a few pages of these mazes, and he was happy.

Unfortunately, the ASCII-based maze was not really satisfying for me. So I
wrote code to convert the output of Games::Maze to SVG. This made much nicer
looking mazes. I worked for a while to make the lines look better and to vary
the corners to generate mazes that looked even better.

But the mazes were still missing something. So, I added the scripting support
that would make the maze playable. I wrapped an HTML form around the
generation program to allow it to be launched from the web.

I made this version available on my website. A friend of mine made some
suggestions for individual visual changes that I incorporated. The design of
the code did not change much during the next year. It was still a quick hacked
wrapper around Games::Maze without much flexibility.

A year later, a comment on the SVG Developers mailing list made me dust off the
code with an ey towards making a legitimate Perl module out of it. When I began
looking at the code again, I realized that the original had been more of a hack
than I remembered. The new version still could use some significant cleanup, but
I am much happier with the overall design.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Games::Maze::SVG;

  my $maze = Games::Maze::SVG->new( 'Rect', wallform => 'roundcorners' );

  my $svgout = $maze->toString();

=head1 OVERVIEW

The Games::Maze::SVG module can produce interactive or non-interactive mazes
in SVG of three basic shapes. The shape of the maze is determined by the first
parameter. This parameter is a string with one of the following values:

=over 4

=item Rect

A maze with a rectangular overall shape and rectangular hallways.

=item RectHex

A maze with a rectangular overall shape and hallways made from hexagonal cells.

=item Hex

A maze with a hexagonal overall shape and hallways made from hexagonal cells.

=back

The mazes can be further configured using a set of named parameters that follow
the shape parameter. Most of these parameters are independent of the shape
chosen. In addition, the \C<mazeparams> parameter supports passing parameters
directly to the internal Games::Maze object which is used to create the maze.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS

The following describes the parameters supported by the Games::Maze::SVG
constructor.

=over 4

=item crumb

String describing the breadcrumb style. Legal values are 'dash', 'dot', 'line',
and 'none'. The default value is 'dash'. The different styles are:

=over 4

=item dash

A dashed line alternating 5 pixels on and 3 pixels off.

=item dot

A dotted line with 2 pixel dots 6 pixels apart.

=item line

A solid line one pixel wide.

=item none

No breadcrumb path.

=back

=item wallform

String naming the wall format. Legal values depend on which shape is selected.

=item dir

Directory in which to find the ecmascript for the maze interactivity. Should
either be relative, or in URL form. The default value is 'scripts/'.

=item interactive

This parameter determines if the maze will be interactive. If the value of the
parameter is true (1), the appropriate scripting and support is written into
the SVG. If the parameter is omitted or false, no interactive support is
provided.

=item cols

The number of columns used in creating the maze. Default value is 12.

=item rows

The number of rows used in creating the maze. Default value is 12.

=item startcol

The column where the entry is found. Default value is random.

=item endcol

The column where the exit is found. Default value is random.

=back

The wallform parameter has different legal values depending on the shape of the
maze.

=head2 Rect

The rectangular maze supports the forllowing wall forms:

=over 4

=item straight

All walls are straight and all corners are simple right angles.

=item round

All corners are rounded, both inside and out of the maze.

=item roundcorners

Only outside corners are rounded.

=item bevel

All corners are beveled to give a somewhat less square appearance.

=back

The default wallform for the Rect maze shape is straight.

=head2 RectHex

The RectHex maze shape supports only one wallform: straight. This form gives
ordinary hexagonal cells throughout the maze. Obviously, this is also the
default wall form.

=head2 Hex

The Hex maze shape supports only one wallform: straight. This form gives
ordinary hexagonal cells throughout the maze. Obviously, this is also the
default wall form.

=cut
