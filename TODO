TODO list for changes to Games::Maze::SVG

1. Circular dependency between Games::Maze::SVG and its subclasses
   I need to separate the interface class from the base class.

2. Add support for playing the game with a mouse.
   Can't play on a tablet that has no keys.

3. Convert README to markdown for better results on GitLab.
